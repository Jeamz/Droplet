# Droplet
Droplet (Project Novo) is a easy to use idea-sharing platform. The product involves users submitting ideas for projects or businesses, where then the community can review and give feedback on that said idea or 'Drop' to the user. This enables projects, ideas, businesses, and global causes - to grow much faster by exposing it to a wide range of people to give feedback. The media is in the from of pictures and some text explaining it, which makes the app to be user friendly and visually appealing.

Story: My friend and I spent the summer of 2017 learning and building this app from the ground up. We got our inspiration from mentors and fellow peers at school. Over the course of 3 months or so, we learned a lot about iOS development and business. This was one of my first 'major' projects undertook. Most of the skills and coding was learned via Youtube or other online sources.
